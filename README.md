# TwitchIRCBot
A Twitch bot built using Node.js

## Setup
Run 'npm install' within the project directory to install all required node modules

Copy config.js.new to personal.js and fill in the details using your Twitch information.
Don't worry config.js will not be committed, it is included in the .gitignore file.

## Running the bot
Run 'node app.js' from within the project directory

## Notes
Still a work in progress.
If you want to help and support please do pull request if you found a fix and or a better way to code a part.

### Thanks for checking this bot out
